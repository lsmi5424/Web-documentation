			<h2>Home Page</h2>
			<p>The home page created in the prototype is very simlar to the one proposed. I decided to keep this exact layout from the proposal as I thought it was simple and clear to the user. </p>
      <h4> Homepage Wireframe </h4>

      <h4> Homepage Mockup </h4>
        <img src="Images/Mockup1.png"/>
      </figure>

       <figure>
         <h4> Final Homepage </h4>
         <img src="Images/homepage.png"/>
       </figure>

			<h3 id="Header">Header</h3>
			<p>Some things I changed included the font for the title of the website. However, I kept the colour scheme and grid layout. I kept this using the CSS grid tool.
     </p>
     <p> I also reduced the size of the RFDS logo to fit within the header. </p>
      <h3 id="Navigation">Nav bar</h3>
			<p>
    In the Navigation bar, what I changed was the spacing between each section.</p>
    <p> 
    I did this for two reasons:
    <li> The layout when displayed on a phone didn't look right </li>
    <li> Having it one long blue bar looked more seemless </li> 
    </p>
		</section>
		<section id="emergency">
			<h2>Emergency Contact page</h2>
			<p>Much of the design was changed for this page. The main change was:
        <li> The layout of each state number. This was done because of layout issues I ran into once i tried to execute it. I rearranged the layout and added an image to fill up the space. </li>
     
      </p>
			<h3 id="title">Title</h3>
			<p>Another thing I changed with the header with the page title that was proposed in my mock up. This is because when placed on the page it didn't look how I imaged. Also I took into consideration the user accessibility and whether it could be viewed by those with visibilty issues and I decided it wasn't the right choice
        </p>
        <h4> Mockup </h4>
        	<figure>
				<img src="Images/Mockup2.png"/>
           </figure>
      <h4> Final Emergency Contact Page </h4>
         <figure>
        <img src="Images/Emergency.png"/>
    
      </figure>
		</section>
		<section id="Donate">
			<h2>Donation page</h2>
			<p> The donation page changed quite a bit for one main reason being my knowledge on how to execute it. With the HTML form knowledge I have, the design i proposed wasn;t possible </p>
			<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
			<p> The layout change where it is now in the verticle line down the page. I thought this would be easier for the user to follow and not miss any sections.</p>
			<!-- Use the figure element for embedding images and iframes with annotations/captions -->
		<h4> Final Donation page </h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="Images/donation1.png"/>
        <img src="Images/donation2.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3 id="Information">Information on the page</h3>
      <p>I also added more information as after researching other donation pages i found that they ask for a lot more information than i had anticipated in the propsal. </p>
		</section>
    <section id="service">
			<h2>Our services page</h2>
      <p> I didn't change much about the sevices page and is almost idendical the the mockup I proposed, besides the title image that I decided to remove from all the pages. </p>
        <figure>
        <img src="Images/Mockup4.png"/>
        <img src="Images/services.png"/>
      </figure>
    </section>   
    <section id="stats">
			<h2>New Statistics and location pages</h2>
      <p> I added two new pages to the final prototype that I did not include in the proposal. I did this becuase i thought these pages provided good information for the user to promote them to participate in the call to action. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="Images/stats.png"/>
        <img src="Images/location.png"/>
